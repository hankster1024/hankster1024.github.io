The ledgend of zelda is an action adventure game about exploring dungeons and getting murdered by chickens.
You spend most of the game exploring dungeons to get usless things like pizza toppings just to convince the master sword to join you in your fight because it's the only things that can defeat the main antagonist pig (his actual name is gannon). Unless you have a fishing rod, or a bug net, or a bottle. Whyd you even need that thing.
